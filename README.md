Optimization Algorithms in C

This project demonstrates two fundamental optimization algorithms implemented in the C programming language. It is designed to showcase both Dynamic Programming (DP) and Greedy Algorithm techniques.

‚ú® Features

Coin Change (Minimum Coins ‚Äì DP)

Finds the minimum number of coins needed to make a given amount.

Returns -1 if the amount cannot be formed with the given denominations.

Fractional Knapsack (Greedy)

Selects items to maximize total value within a weight capacity.

Items can be broken into fractions to achieve optimal results.
